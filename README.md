# MAGD 150 Projects

# Lab Assignment 10 
In this project we worked with 3d enviornments and primitives along with lights and JSON files. It is a sketch that involves camera movement with both the camera and translate functions. The user can zoom in on the 3d objects with moving the mouse over the sketch on the X axis, and translating the objects forward when the mouse is being pressed and moved on the Y axis

# Lab Assignment 9
In this project we worked with inserting video and sound into the sketch. This sketch utilises the users camera and puts a grey filter over it. It also uses a HTML button to play a cracking sound when it is pressed with the mouse.

#Lab Assignment 8
In this project we worked with loading fonts, displaying text on the screen, as well as loading strings from external files. This sketch displays two photos, one as the background and a translucent one in the foreground. This also loads two fonts with text imported from an external file. The text changes colors when the mouse is pressed. There is also a part of the text which follows the X and Y position of the mouse on the canvas.

#Lab Assignment 1
In this project we worked with using 2d primatives and getting used to the p5.js X,Y co-ordinate system. This assignment was very fun for me to work on and I enjoyed learning the very basics of p5.js though this assignment. I got the inspiration for this sketch from a video on YouTube called Cream by David Firth. Here's a link if you would like to see it, I can't recommend it enough! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UgiJPnwtQU&t=408s specific image used as inspiration at 6:48
